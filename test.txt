Time: 2016-09-06T19:00:00+01:00 Event: Djembe Drumming Description: The Bonkerz Drumming group meets every Tuesday in Plumstead Library during term time and has been doing so for over two years. Its previous home was at Crown Woods School in Eltham but the hope is to carry on here in Plumstead for as long as we can.
 
The drums we play are called djembe (pronounced JEM-bay) and they are one of the most versatile percussion instruments around. The djembe drum is said to have been invented in the 12th Century by the Mandinke tribe in what is now Mali, in West Africa. Its huge popularity is down to the fact that it can create an unusually wide range of pitches, namely the bass (low), tone (medium) and slap (high). These sounds are created by striking different areas of the djembe skin with the hands.
 
Beginners as well as people, who have played before, are most welcome and drums are provided at no extra cost if you don’t have your own. Currently, the group has a wide age range and a few more female members than male so it really is open to all. However, if a child wishes to attend it would be necessary for them to be accompanied by a responsible adult.
